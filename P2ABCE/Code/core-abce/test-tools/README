Test Tool
=============
This project contains a number of tools useful for tests.


Verifiaction Debugger
-------------
The verification debugger is a barebone tool for verifying a
presentation token against a presentation policy.

The tool works by creating test cases for a pair of token and 
policy. Using tests compared to a command line utility is that
we ensure that any bugs found by an invalid pair of token and 
policy does not creep back into the code base.

The tool works by specifying three parameters:
* presentationPolicyFile - path to the policy file
* presentationTokenFile - path to the token file
* debuggerResourceFolder - path to a directory containing 
    credential specifications and issuer parameters

The debuggerResourceFolder should be unique for each test case.
